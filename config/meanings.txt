The following is an explaination on the configs
"config.json" has a list in it for the filenames that will be found and run and the command to run them in terminal by subprocess
"sysFiles.json" is the list of files that the program has made itself. It reads the list of the keys and will either turn a process on or off from the list. Throwing an error if it isn't "enable" or "disable".
